-   Styled my footer. Don't laugh

-   Designed a favicon

Feelin under the weather today. I might have pushed my body a little hard with the long days and uninterrupted staring at the screen. We are a pomodoro household, but I've been happily ignoring my timers, gritting my teeth and _wanting this thing to be done *today*_. Probably not the healthiest approach. Wish I could do it more low and slow, sometimes.

Adding things to my 100dod bucketlist. I don't even know what design means to me. Have I mentioned that before? Part of this is going to be figuring this out. I hope it gets philosophical. I feel like I've got at least one post about the meaning of the word 'design' in me. uuu, also - _affordances_.
