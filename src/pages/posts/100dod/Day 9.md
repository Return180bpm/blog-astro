-   Made a few sketches for my new CV in Figma

-   Made some grey color palettes ðŸ˜Œ

Not sure if I have anything to say. Feelin tired, maybe I didn't sleep all too well.

I'm having a naughty kind of fun with my CV. Writing it in a 'normal', ''standard'', '''expected''' way kind of stresses me out. But I've found an antidote: Being honest. Like, advertising-that-I-am-a-mess-kind-of-honest. And then all of the pressure of _presenting myself_ falls away, and I can start making something interesting.

Not sure if I'll actually send any of these drafts, but they definitely help with getting me past the blockage. After I get my juices flowing, I can always trim down the crazy. Or at least how much I show of it :).

Wrapped into this is the question of what kind of work and work relationships... do I want... are possible... are desirable... are realistic... are healthy? etc. etc. I feel split between 'I love you as a colleague, but don't call me after 6' and 'y'all my peeps, let's do thimgs together, why not also after work?'

Have I mentioned that I'm looking for a job? ðŸ˜‹
