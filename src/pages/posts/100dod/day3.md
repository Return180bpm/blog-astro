-   Designed cards for day 2 and 3\
    _I'm not telling how much time that took_

-   Designed the landing page for mobile

-   Made my boi [Astro](https://astro.build/) get all my blog posts (which are markdown files) and display them on a single page

I feel slightly, uhm, dissatisfied with the design for the landing page. I tell myself it's a rough sketch. It lives in Figma. I'm slightly proud of my component setup, using some atomic design principles. It's really cool to see changes made to an individual part (like this piece of text) ripple down and spread to all posts in the prototype.
I'm gonna start implementing this in CSS tomorrow. I gave up the idea that the design has to be perfect before building it. And it feels so freeing (thank You, [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/)) Iteration, baby. Itration, bab. Filtration, bb. Get rid of the ideas that are stopping You (I feel like I should be saying this through a megaphone, but not in a good way). Kind of curious to see where this will go.
