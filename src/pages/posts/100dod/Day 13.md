-   Read through the accessibility guidelines of Material Design 3.0

-   Listened to a couple of videos and TED talks about design

One of the talks was basically urging designers to have a conscience - or at least consider the long-term consequences of their designs.

Reminded me of one of life's most flustering clusterfucks:

"We are doing things. That's good. But are these the right things?"

"Is our well-being the paramount factor in our decisions? What if we can't agree on how to operationalize well-being?"

"We are growing. Great. ... Growing to do what - more of the same things?"
