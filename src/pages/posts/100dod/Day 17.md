-   Researched a bunch of stuff around Material Design (implementation, use-cases, MD 2 vs 3)

-   Set up a Material Design framework within my Vue coding project

In my research I learned that MD 3 isn't even baked into any of the Vue frameworks that are available. Looks like I'll have to customize my the framework I've picked, or implement it from scratch.

Don't know what to write. Feels like the same existential crisis I've been in since I did my coding bootcamp in 2020. What am I even doing? Setting up build-environments for hours at a time, failing to install npm packages, copying CSS-build-chains from example projects and crossing my fingers hoping they work. Man, after a day of doing such things, I definitely feel like I've taken a turn in the wrong direction.

It feels kind of soulless. I feel like there are things to unpack here, but I just spent a good 5 minutes staring at the wall and no coherent expression wants to come out.

I'm slightly proud I've made some solid progress on my weekly goals. And it feels good being on a streak, doing a few tiny steps every day. New challenges tomorrow.
