-   **Worked on my CV**

-   **Talked to some ppls**

My last post was like a week ago. I've changed the rules for this challenge - I don't wanna be doing this on the weekends if I don't want to.

But more interesting, I've had some kind of realization about design, what it means to me and what I want to be (not) doing with this challenge.

I'm a little wiser... or about to be. Everything is still pretty messy and fresh. I wrote some words, but it felt like I was skirting around the issue. What's the issue, you ask?

When I find out... ..

In the next... ...
