-   **Worked on my CV**

-   **Talked to some ppls**

-   **Made some prototypes for _off the dome_**

First of all, I got a tiny mountain of stuff done today, despite feeling low-ish. üí• High five, üêª hug, and a little pat on the fanny for me! ü§¶

My last post was like a week ago. I've changed the rules for this challenge - I don't wanna be doing this on the weekends if I don't want to.

But more interesting, I've had some kind of realization about design, what it means to me and what I want to be doing with this challenge.

After another two days of failed installations, config-files and general frontend setup,
I don't want to be doing that. I do not enjoy this kind of low-level hacking, trying out beta-versions and browsing through barely existing documentation. I want things to work.

There was suffering in the last two days. The kind that really feels like it's hardly worth it. This was something optional. Something I really wanted (try out Material Design for myself), but something I could have let go and saved for a later project. I could have pivoted, but didn't. Even when the path I kept on felt like I was treading water for the umptieth day in a row, I kept on going, _TO GET IT DONE_.
I would like to explore this further. What sort of unfun, unuseful things do I keep doing for some convoluted reason?

So it seems I've had to put myself through a few days of software torture to realize and accept that I don't like to setup software.

I like computers, sometimes.

I like to make things, like apps, websites, pictures, music.

But I don't enjoy low-level hacking. Installing packages. Hanging out in config files. Setting up toolchains (curiously, that can be fun in Ableton). These are things I respect and acknowledge as necessary, but I really would like them to work out of the box. Reliably. And have extensive documentation.

I feel like there might be a point I am skirting around: do I really want to be a front end dev? Develop apps for a living?

-   Gi is a front end dev who doesnt do all that shit
-   I'm scared to go for it - design, UI, UX

I spent the last two days mostly trying to get various component frameworks to play nice with my learning project (_off the dome_). If that sounds boring to you, then you're not alone. It is soul-sucking to me and I've had enough of it.

I don't want to make that part of this challenge or write about it. It's a chore that has to be done sometimes, but the research, tinkering with config files and the trial-and-error...

I feel like I'm still salty about it. It just feels like wasted time. I can't bring myself to be Zen about this - view it as part of the process, learn to find something in it. This kind of low-level hacking just feels zombifying at the end of the day. I feel like I'm facing my mortality and absolutely wasting my life. Really getting into some absurd territory.

The funny thing is how no one is forcing me to do this but myself. I could have found simpler solutions that don't require this sort of low-level hacking. But I made myself miserable for another two days.(I've been trying to integrate a Material Design framework into this app for on and off two weeks.)

I realized that I didn't want to call tinkering with couldn't be called design
