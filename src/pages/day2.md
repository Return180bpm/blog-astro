-   Set up my blog with [Astro](https://astro.build/)\
    _omg and it worked out of the box_

-   Read about [SSG and SSR](https://allthecode.co/blog/post/ssr-vs-ssg-vs-spa-what-does-it-all-mean) (web paradigms)\
    _And stored my newly found knowledge in Notion (aka filing away :)_

-   Set up a basic layout and blog post template in Astro\
    _Before God said 'Let there be light!', there was probably some Googling_

-   Started writing down the things that I might do in these 100 days

A lot of techy stuff. It's been 2 days of setup - researching SSGs, trying them out, doing some frustrates. But it's done. I feel like I can work with Astro. I see some Figma designing and CSS styling in my future.
