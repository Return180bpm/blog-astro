    A mess of words in different fonts and bars of color that partly frame, overlap and underline the text: "100 Days of Design", "19". The 19 is big and bold, taking up about half of the image. The word 'days' is set in two different fonts: 'DAY' is big and bold like the 19, the 's' is much smaller. The colored bars are a pinkish red, a canary yellow and a deep purple.

-   **Learned a little more about fonts**: how different fonts have different emotional effects, played [this game](https://game.fonts.adobe.com/) and discussed with my partner, looked at [these fonts made by womxn](https://www.design-research.be/by-womxn/)

-   **Worked on my CV design**: set the layout for a simple version, looked at the designs I've made so far, even liked some of them :), organized my ideas/cleaned up my Figma file
