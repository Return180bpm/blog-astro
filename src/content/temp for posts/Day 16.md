    The text 'Day 16' in big bold letters in front of a rectangular blackish shape, whose angles and ornamental protrusions make me think of a chest, podium or altar. Running through the letters are vertical stripes in a pinkish red, violet purple and canary yellow. Below, in thin letters of a standard reading size, the text '100 Days of Design', as if part of the dark shape.

-   Read about type (as in typeface): learned about how to choose the right type for the occasion, the OpenFont standard, types of numerals, and some basic vocabulary like cap height and tracking

-   Worked hard on my CV design: continued with the simplified grayscale version, tried out some different ways to group information, and added content to the _Values_-section. Made some screenshots of interesting CVs for inspiration

I emphasize that I worked hard, because it felt like that: spending lot of energy to little effect, fiddling with details without being clear about the message that I want to convey. This was hard work, not smart work.

Working on a CV tends to bring out some deep-seated conflicts within me. This happens almost every time I do a redesign. I come back to some fundamental questions:

-   Do I focus on getting a job ASAP or getting better at designing? - Should I go with a template or invest some time in learning how to do a layout?

-   Should I follow _"established conventions"_ or do things my way - like maybe be radically honest from the get-go?

And the kicker:

-   Should I even be investing all this effort into achieving a goal which I'm not even that excited about (working at some company, possibly full-time)

The answer is probably no. But something in me is stuck and doesn't see an alternative. Hm hm hm.

### Redesigning My CV

Hyper-insecurity. A vibe of _"my whole life has been a failure and I am nothing."_ Skipping the '_Work Experience_-section, because (feeling like) there's no work experience worth talking about. Trying to fill in the resulting white space with something. Looking at the whole and only seeing a mess. Deciding to embrace the mess and be honest: mention depression in a section called _My Story_! Coming back the next day and feeling like that's the most ridiculous and unnecessarily exhibitionistic thing in the world. Doubting the whole be-radically-honest-plan. Maybe I should rewrite everything? Maybe I should put depression in like the footer of the cover letter?

Feel ooof.
