## Wednesday

Went to a dance with U last night. 
Barely slept. Worst night in weeks. Something something intestines? Something something emotions? I was running hot, as usual. Literally. Stewing in my sheets. (Chewie in the streets, Stewie in the sheets.) Kept my cool though -- no screen time. Just put on [a Horrorbabble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU3gubouRlY&pp=ygUieW91dCBuZWNyb21hbnRpYyB0YWxlIGhvcnJvcmJhYmJsZQ%3D%3D) a few times. Got to the morning, somehow. 

So, the date with U. I'm like *do I wanna see her again??!?!!!?* Part of me has reasons not to: she seemed kind of uncomfortable and anxious, especially for the second half....
You know what, as I'm writing I already know that the other part will win: give her a second chance. Cuz in essence, I found her sweet (and she's cute and hot and a little bit mysterious, too). 

She was in my head a lot this sleepless night. 

I got these surges of anxiety whenever I thought about some interactions with the regulars at last night's dance. Everytime this or that particular interaction popped into my head, it made me suck in a lungful of air. A big whince. Then a big sigh. Which interaction was it again? <Some particulars I went through in the original journal entry.> Neither of these elicits much of a reaction at this moment. I thought it would be an interesting thing to look at. 

I kind of got nothin. To look at. I've got insomniac brain fog. I just spaced out for like 2 minutes imagining a redesign for this blog. I wonder if a stark 2-color light and dark color scheme could work or if it would be too metal for this material. I'm feeling very tempted to try it out.
