        A background of columns of repeated text: 100 Days of Design. The text is clear at the top and bottom and gets sort of smudged towards the middle. Over this, a big golden circle with bold text: Day 20. Over this, two wavy sort of blobs, touching the edges of the image. The one in the upper-right: blue. The one in the lower left: blackish and spilling out of the bottom of the image.

-   **Worked on my CV**

-   **Talked to some ppls**

-   **Made some prototypes for _off the dome_**

First of all, I got a tiny mountain of stuff done today, despite feeling low-ish. üí• High five, üêª hug, and a little pat on the fanny for me! ü§¶

My last post was like a week ago. I've changed the rules for this challenge - I don't wanna be doing this on the weekends if I don't want to.

But more interesting, I've had some kind of realization about design, what it means to me and what I want to be (not) doing with this challenge.

I'm a little wiser... or about to be. Everything is still pretty messy and fresh. I wrote some words, but it felt like I was skirting around the issue. What's the issue, you ask?

Find out...

When I find out... ..

In the next... ...
