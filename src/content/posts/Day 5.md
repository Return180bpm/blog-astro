-   [Read](https://www.tpgi.com/a-web-of-anxiety-accessibility-for-people-with-anxiety-and-panic-disorders-part-1/) about [making things accessible](https://uxdesign.cc/inclusive-ux-in-an-era-of-anxiety-dc89c39ec202?gi=49e420d43c69) for ppl with anxiety

-   Implemented (reinvented) my Figma designs

-   Studied the markup of [a blog of someone who cares about accessibility](https://lovenonsense.com/): Vasilis van Gemert

-   Read up on some of the basic semantic markup elements like `<article>`. Also `<time>`

-   Tidied up my Notion project page for this blog

It's been a day. A day at the computer. A day of thousand little lessons. I must have changed course a dozen times today - realizing that what I want to do takes much more effort and care than I had thought (like converting dates in JavaScript).

In the end, I'm pretty happy with the result - the page looks presentable and all that's left for this iteration is to change the favicon and maybe buy a domain.

But man, it's been a long day. I got this strange feeling that comes when I spend the whole day inside, making things happen on a screen. I've been working on this thing in isolation for a few days now. I wanna get this baby out and let it go.

Had some sweet roasted veggies tho.
