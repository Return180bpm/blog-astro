-   Posted some 'hey all, here's me, let's connect!'-messages to some local telegram groups

-   Watched a few 'things I wish I knew before becoming a designer'-videos

-   Researched a company I want to apply to

-   Worked on a CV design in Figma

Feels like a productive day. I'm a little disappointed I didn't finish this CV design - but man, arranging words on a page can be hard!

Nothing much more to say, it seems. My head just wants to solve these layout-challenges - do I emphasize this heading with font size, font weight, background color or all of the above? I wanna keep it minimal but then I also wanna have a color shade between these other 2 colors, so I can... etc. thimgs b complex (tm)

Now that I think about it, in the next session I might take all the colors out and just focus on the arrangement and information hierarchy. Unfuck the cluster I kind of got myself into and work in greyscale for a while. I love it bright and saturated, but I also like it simple and doable :). And I can always add colors later.
_(Credit for my ex-co-worker Felix for telling me about this tactic and for Refactoring UI for introducing it to us (I keep mentioning this book, because it's the only hands-on design book I've read. I'm not affiliated with them)_
