[edited journal excerpt]

i've also made the decision to be more chill with my mom and not to take her neurosis so seriously. i try to laugh instead. many times we end up laughing together. 
tears after writing this. life is so goddamn messy, so abysmally imperfect. you start out yearning for wholeness and connection, but most of the time you end up laughing at the absurdity of this monkey existence.
