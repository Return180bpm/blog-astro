Feeling sad. Sad and burnt out. I've been feeling like this on and off for weeks. It strikes me that this mood seems to come into the foreground whenever I manage to get a decent night of sleep in. I've often been totally zombified and brain-dead because I can't sleep very well in my current apartment. When I do rest a bit - I seem to wake up in this mood. It feels like there's a veil of sadness over me and it weighs a 100 tons.

Makes me wonder about _moods_...How do they stay so consistent, for days, weeks, sometimes years? I wake up and it's like my mood is already waiting for me, pre-made and laid out for me to step into it.

It feels like there's me and then there's this mood. _It_ is envelopping me. I'm the object, being suffocated, dragged down. It's weird, a little like losing bodily control: a leg falling asleep, a tired muscle giving out after a work out... That little friction coming between will and flesh jolts me into realizing: I'm just a driver doing his best to steer a lagging vessel. - Lift my leg carefully to make a step, catch my balance, or try to get shit done while being dragged to the bottom of the ocean.
