I often wolf down my food,  
my head racing,  
filled with a million thoughts  
\- everything except  
the food I'm eating.  

A little ritual helps me switch modes.  
Because sometimes  
I don't want to work,  
or solve anything,  
I simply want to have a meal  
\- whatever that means.  

Maybe I take two seconds  
to appreciate what's on my plate.  
It's gonna feed me, after all,  
and give me the energy  
to do whatever I'm doing.  

Taking a slow bite  
can be a fun thing to do,  
tasting, feeling
- that's it.   

I could even  
think about where this food came from...  
but that can lead to big things,  
and big changes in consciousness, indeed.  

I might even not take  
my shit so seriously  
after that,  
for a minute.
