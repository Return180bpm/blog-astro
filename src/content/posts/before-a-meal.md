I often wolf down my food,  
my head racing,  
filled with a million thoughts  
\- everything except  
the food I'm eating.  

A little ritual helps me switch modes.  
Because sometimes  
I just want to have a meal  
\- whatever that means.  

Maybe I take two seconds  
to see what's on my plate.  
It's gonna feed me, after all,  
and give me the energy  
to do whatever I'm doing.  

Taking a slow bite  
can be fun:  
feel it, taste it  
\- that's it.   

I could even  
think about where this food came from...  
but that can lead to big thoughts,  
indeed.  

I might even not take  
my shit so seriously  
after that,  
for a minute.
