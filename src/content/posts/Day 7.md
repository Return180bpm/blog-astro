        A squarish image, the creamy light background melting into the background of the page. A series of concentric blobs using this week's color palette - from outside in: canary yellow, fleshy red, a very dark brown they call old burgundy and in the middle the same creamy color as the background. Text - "Day 7" giant and stretched, hovering like a blimp at the top of the image, behind the blobs. Text - "100 Days of Design", the words neatly stacked in the bottom right corner.

-   thought about how we are supposed to write dates in the English-speaking world and how far removed that is from how we speak\
    _I wrote this on August 7 - not 7th. Or how about the absurd amount of commas in Sunday, August 7, 2022_

-   techy: fiddled around with a lot of CSS on both a macro and a micro scale\
    _I'm starting to develop an appreciation for some of the trials and tribulations involved in styling a website_

-   wrote some microcopy for the footer\
    _Interesting how many different tones you can put into 5 or 6 words_

This is like the third day (3 day) where I'm thinking 'ok, I'm gonna announce this thing tomorrow'. (I have worked on this blog for a week but haven't announced it yet.) But I can see now, even tho I'm doing progress, and I've ticked off several items from my list of _essentials for launch_ today, I've also added several more. I think it's good enough tho (and as I write this, something profoundly disagrees). It is tho. It's gonna get published tomorrow, on a fresh monday.

Apart from that, I don't know, I'm feeling morose. The work progresses, but it also consumes. I want some sunlight on my face.
