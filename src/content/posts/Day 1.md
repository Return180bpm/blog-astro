-   Designed several cover images in Figma.\
    _I thought this was a good way to get my juices flowing in the morning_

-   Tried to set up several SSGs to start this blog\
    _The humanity_

-   Started making a mental list of things I want to achieve in these 100 days\
    _Does it count if it's exclusively mental?_
