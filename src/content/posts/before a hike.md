i set out to travel.

knowing we cannot step out of life,
me, myself and I 
will see this world 
from another place
for a while.

i accept
i am not at peace.
i don't feel ready
or like it is the right moment.

i go 
because i have chosen to go
for reasons clear and unclear
and i yield to both.

i'm going now, everything be damned!

i leave 
a mess or two
and things unfinished,
unbegun.
many projects,
problems.
things that will still be there
and things that may be gone
or different.

i take
all parts of me
because they are coming anyway
with joy
and spite
and pain
and cheer
and many words unsaid

i'm going
